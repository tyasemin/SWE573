🕵️‍♀️ Case 1: The Vanishing of Alex Rowe
Status: Still missing — presumed alive.
Date of Disappearance: April 14th, 9:42 PM
Location: Eastbound platform, Hollow Pines Train Station
Age: 29
Occupation: Freelance graphic designer — worked mostly remote
Last Known Appearance: CCTV footage — Alex walking alone, wearing a grey hoodie, black jeans, and carrying a red backpack

🧩 The Clues
Clue 1: One-Way Ticket to Ravenhill

Purchased in cash 30 minutes before departure

Ravenhill is a near-abandoned town, population 214

No record of Alex ever mentioning or researching it

The train arrived — Alex never disembarked, according to conductor logs

Clue 2: The Red Backpack

Found 48 hours later at the edge of Lakemoor Woods

Contents: empty water bottle, an old map of Ravenhill (creased, possibly secondhand), and a page torn from a book — title unknown, only the words “no one listens until you’re gone” are legible

No fingerprints on any of the items except Alex’s

Clue 3: 2:17 AM Call

Placed from Alex’s phone to a burner

Phone turned off at 2:19 AM

Number registered to no name, deactivated minutes later

Last ping: cell tower 8 miles west of Ravenhill — no public road access

Clue 4: Diary Entry (April 11)

“Sometimes you have to vanish to be seen. But will they look? Will they really look, or just move on?”

Entry is smudged, water damage suspected — possibly tears

Last entry in the notebook

👤 The Suspects
Erin Walsh (Roommate)

Claims Alex had spoken vaguely of "starting over"

Initially said she was home that night — later changed story, saying she was “out for air”

Seen near Lakemoor on the 15th. Claims she was “just walking.” No alibi between 10 PM–1 AM

Motive? Unknown — possibly jealousy, unresolved conflict?

Dr. Ira Keller (Former Therapist)

License revoked two years ago due to ethical concerns — boundary violations with a previous client

Last person Alex texted: “Can we talk? This time I need you to actually listen.”

Interview evasive. Claimed no recent contact, denied receiving the message

Unknown Contact: “E”

Mentioned 17 times across Alex’s last 30 messages

No saved number, no public trace

Messages suggest emotional intimacy — one read: “I can’t do this without you. Promise me you’ll be there.”

The burner phone called at 2:17 AM may belong to “E”

🔍 Additional Notes
Weather: Heavy fog rolled into the region on April 14th, starting around 9:30 PM

Security Cameras: Footage between Ravenhill station and Lakemoor went offline for 15 minutes during that night — unusual spike in power grid

The Lake: Divers searched the nearby water. No body found. But a shoe believed to be Alex’s was recovered — clean, as if never worn outdoors

Theory from Investigator #3: “This doesn’t look like someone escaping. This looks like someone being erased.”
